# BWF-Tournament-Win-Rate-Analysis
_Analyzing factors contributing to badminton match win rate using tournament data from the Badminton World Federation (BWF)
_

For my final project for the Introduction to Data Science (STATS 15) course, I, along with four other team members, analyzed factors contributing to the win rate for a badminton match using data from the Badminton World Federation (BWF). We analyze how homecourt advantage, ranking, and set-win advantage could affect a player and/or team's chances of winning a badminton match. For single-variable analysis, we created visualization on the various nationalities, rankings, etc. from our dataset as a baseline of identifier distributions. 

We sourced our data from Kaggle, scraped from the BWF using Python, and cleaned plus performed our EDA using R and R-Studio.
